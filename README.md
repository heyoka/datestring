This fork will output millisecond precision at max.
Furthermore there a two more format symbols for milliseconds("c") and nanoseconds("f") besides the microseconds symbol "u".







Parse and Format Date and Time in Erlang
========================================

This library implements basic functionality to parse and format date and time
in Erlang.

## Usage

### Parsing

The `datestring` module exposes three functions for parsing:

* `parse_date/2`
* `parse_time/2`
* `parse_datetime/2`

All three functions take a *format string* as the first argument. The second
argument should be a string containing the date to be parsed.

Note that time is not returned as a standard time-tuple (`{H, M, S}`), but
a tuple containing a time-tuple and microseconds as an integer.

Examples:

    {ok,{2012,12,24}} = datestring:parse_date("Y-m-d", "2012-12-24").

    {ok,{{23,12,0},0}} = datestring:parse_time("I:M P", "11:12 p.m.").

    {ok,{{2012,12,24},{{23,12,0},0}}} =
        datestring:parse_datetime("Y-m-d H:M", "2012-12-24 23:12").

    {error,invalid_date} = datestring:parse_date("Y-m-d", "2012-13-24").

    {error,no_match} = datestring:parse_date("d-m-Y", "2012-12-24").

### Formatting Dates

* `format/2`

Format tuple containing date and/or time (with or without microseconds)
according to a *format string*. `format/2` takes a *format string* as it's
first argument. The second argument can be either one of:

* A tuple containing a date (`{2012, 12, 24}`).
* A tuple of two tuples (time and microseconds) (`{{23, 12, 0}, 0}`).
* A tuple of two tuples (date and time) {`{2012, 12, 24}, {23, 12, 0}}`)
* A tuple of two tuples (date and time+ms) {`{2012, 12, 24}, {{23, 12, 0}, 0}}`)

Examples:

    {ok,"2012-12-24"} = datestring:format("Y-m-d", {2012, 12, 24}).

    {ok,"11:59 p.m."} = datestring:format("I:M P", {{23, 59, 30}, 0}).

    {ok,"Monday, 24th December 2012"} =
        datestring:format("A, eo B Y", {2012, 12, 24}).

    {ok,"2012-12-24 at 13:12"} =
        datestring:format("Y-m-d \\a\\t H:M", {{2012, 12, 24}, {13, 12, 32}}). 

## Conversion Specification

The format used to parse and format dates closely resembles the one used
in `strftime()`[1]. The most notable exception is that meaningful characters
are not prefixed with a percentage sign (%) in *datestring*.

Characters not matching a conversion specification will be copied to the
output verbatim when formatting and matched against input when parsing.
Meaningful characters can be escaped with a backslash (\\).

Current Status
--------------

I wrote this library a ages ago. It was left forgotten in the darkest corners
of my hdd until recently, when I needed to parse dates in a new project.

Everything has been working fine for the formats I've thrown at it, but the
library needs more extensive testing. I'm also not sure about the API design.

Anyway, a little todo-list:

* More testcases.
* Convert TZ -> offset (probably just a translation table).
* Format offset (three notations "+HH", "+HHMM" and "+HH:MM") and TZs.
* Maybe add locale to the mix.
* Add specs, refactor a little, re-order patterns etc.
